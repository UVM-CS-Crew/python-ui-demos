# Python User Interface Demos

This repository contains all example programs used during CS Crew meetings to show off Python user interface techniques.

## Installing Packages

UI projects typically have a lot of libraries that need to be imported. You can install these on your own, or you can use `pdm`, which is supported by this project.

When cloning into the repositroy, you can run `pdm install` to install the required depenencies. 
> This requires that you have already installed `pdm`.

Once you have installed everything, you can enter the venv that `pdm` created. The command to do so should be:
```zsh
$(pdm venv activate)
```
